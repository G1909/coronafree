## FOREWORD

Management of the end of the lockdown is going to be very difficult if we don't want any comeback of the epidemy.
The ideal would be to free people with positive immunity while keeping other locked. But this is simply impossible to manage (not enough test, huge organization, tests not reliable enough etc....). Some governement are thinking about freeing some regions or youngest firsts.
But the more people you have in the streets and public places, the more it will be tough to control who is free to move or not.

The only way is having a "Dynamic Mobile Pass" with a QR code that grant you access to outside and that keep tracking of close contacts with other mobile phones for a certain duration (e.g. 21 days) to alert in case of possible virus contagious contact case to limit respreading of the virus.

Some countries have already set up mobile apps with contact history (e.g. South Korea, Singapour) and other are setting up mobile phone grant outside access (e.g. France). 

Those applications are highgly data sensitive and may lead to massive governement surveillance with other back purposes in mind. Also they are country state driven while it should be used by several countries especially those with a lot of open borders (e.g. : Europe).
The more the situation is becoming harder for countries the more they are closing for international solidarity (e.g. facial masks war). Meaning each country is having its own solution that will reduce the overall efficiency of limiting virus spreading. Some countries are even not able to manage such solution.

Open Source specifications and software is the best answer to those problems. Governements are not ready for it.
