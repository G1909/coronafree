Public Mobile App to provide contagious contacts history and grant access for non contagious people

Management of the end of the lockdown is going to be very difficult if we don't want any comeback of the epidemy.
The ideal would be to free people with positive immunity while keeping other locked. But this is simply impossible to manage (not enough test, huge organization, tests not reliable enough etc....). Some governement are thinking about free some regions or youngest firsts.
But the more people you have in the streets and public places, the more it will be difficult to controle who is free to move or not.

The only way is having a "Dynamic Mobile Pass" with a QR code that grant you access to outside.

Some countries have already set such mobile apps (e.g. South Korea, Singapour). But those application are highgly sensitive
